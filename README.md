# Fabric Firebase Plugin for Cordova
Cordova plugin to integrate Fabric.io along with Firebase Cordova plugin. This plugin must be always used along with `cordova-plugin-firebase`, otherwise it won't work or even the application build can fail.

This plugin allows you to register your application on Fabric. So this will show up to the Fabric console once you launch it.
